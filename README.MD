# The Thirst for Australia Red Wine

Say we wanted to look at historic sales data (around, say, Australian Red Wine) and use it to predict how much would get sold in the future. Of course, we'd do this in Python, the king of data analysis languages :troll: ....

## Source Data

I got some source data from here:

https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B76mgCvz1US5amZmUXlmY3RwMGc

It just gives us, by month from Jan 1980 forwards, a measure of the volume of australian red wine sold by month. Lets analyse this in iPython!


## Running the Project

Ok so clone the repository, then create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```
virtualenv --no-site-packages ven
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -R requirements.txt
```

If alls gone well, now we can launch the iPython notebook like this:

```
jupyter notebook
```

This should open a new browser window, and we'll got from there :)
